In this project, I start by creating a Django project and setting up the basic project structure. I then start a local server and create an application called "categories." Next, I focus on URL tracking and displaying text on the site. I also work with HTML templates and add styles to the site using the Jinja Template Engine.
Next, I design models and do migrations to set up the database. I also explore the admin panel, which allows me to manage the data in the database. Finally, I create a page for adding data to the database and learn how to get and output data from the database. Overall, this project covers a wide range of topics related to web development with Django.
